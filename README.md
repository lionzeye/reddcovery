Recover private keys from a (corrupted) wallet.dat (Reddcoin)

### Alternatives

I usually have more success using https://github.com/lionzeye/reddcointools or https://github.com/lionzeye/pywallet

### Prerequisites
- PyCoin https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycoin/
- Base58 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/base58/

### Usage

#### From a Windows executable:

- https://github.com/lionzeye/reddcovery/releases/

#### From scratch:

- Start your command-prompt.
- Change your working directory to a directory with our 'reddcovery.py' and 'wallet.dat'.
- Start the script by executing: 

		python reddcovery.py > keys.txt

- Find your private keys in "keys.txt" in your working directory.
